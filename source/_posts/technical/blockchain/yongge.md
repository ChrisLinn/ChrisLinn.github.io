I don't know whether Prof. Wang's 
Another Look at CBC Casper Consensus Protocol
deserves attetions...

He once posted "Another Look at Byzantine Fault Tolerance" and later decided to withdraw it (https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/864)

He also posted [Another Look at ALGORAND](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04463) but received justification from algorand community: his assumptions might be wrong.
