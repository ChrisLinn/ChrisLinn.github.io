- When I was studying in Moscow university,
  foundations of mathematics is a subject is extremely unfashionable.

  There were different groups,
  a group of algebra, a group of topology,
  a group of analysis, a group of differential equations ...,
  there was also a group of foundations of mathematics.

  At the end of second year every student must choose his or her group.
  It was an important choice, and we discuss it a lot,
  and different group has different reputation.

  At my time the group of algebra is very cool, there were famous people in the group.
  the group of topology and geometry was also cool, there were also famous people in the group.

  Some other groups are less cool,
  and the group of foundations of mathematics was almost the least group of all.
  (Maybe except for the history of mathematics.)

  Nobody who think themself a good mathematician will considered going there.

  Back then I went to the group of algebra,
  I still consider myself an algebraist,
  I am applying methods of algebra to other area of mathematics.

  But now I working full time on foundations of mathematics.
  Why?
  How did I get here?
  Am I becoming uncool?

  I am here to explain why the way we are developing the foundations of mathematics
  will make it a very cool subject again.
  (I said "again", became it was a very cool subject during 1910s and 1920s.)
