- When I was studying in Moscow University,
  foundations of mathematics is a subject is extremely unfashionable.

  There were different groups,
  a group of algebra, a group of topology,
  a group of analysis, a group of differential equations ...,
  there was also a group of foundations of mathematics.

  At the end of second year every student must choose his or her group.
  It was an important choice, and we discuss it a lot,
  and different group has different reputation.

  At my time the group of algebra is very cool, there were famous people in the group.
  the group of topology and geometry was also cool, there were also famous people in the group.

  Some other groups are less cool,
  and the group of foundations of mathematics was almost the least group of all.
  (Maybe except for the history of mathematics.)

  Nobody who think themself a good mathematician will considered going there.

  Back then I went to the group of algebra,
  I still consider myself an algebraist,
  I am applying methods of algebra to other area of mathematics.

  But now I working full time on foundations of mathematics.
  Why?
  How did I get here?
  Am I becoming uncool?

  I am here to explain why the way we are developing the foundations of mathematics
  will make it a very cool subject again.
  (I said "again", became it was a very cool subject during 1910s and 1920s.)

Many of us do mathematics that is a little like the Rubik Cube.

There is a problem.
And there is the search for a solution.
And when the solution is found, it is certain that it is a solution.

But the mathematics which earned me the Fields Medal of 2002 in Beijing is very different.

There is a problem.
And there is the search for a solution.
But when the solution is found, it is not certain at all that it is a solution.

(The Fields Medal was awarded to me for the proof of Milnor's Conjecture.)

- Suppose you want to solve a special algebraic equation of degree 5.
  You found the solution by some means,
  then you can substitution the root into the equation to check that it is a solution.

  But if you want to solve a group of 20 equations of degree 20
  or something as complicated like that.
  You found the solution by some means,
  then you have to do a lot of calculation to check your solution.

  Nowaday no one will do it by hand,
  you will use some software to help you verify your solution is a solution.

  Now imagine your problem is to prove some theorem.
  And your solution is a proof.
  How do you verify the proof is really a solution?

  There are some conventions you learned from your teachers or professors,
  about what constitutes a rigorous proof,
  but you can not feed it to a computer to let the computer check it yet.

Back to the Milnor's Conjecture.

The problem is to find a proof of the conjecture.

The search for a solution took me about two years, from 1993 to 1995.

The solution was a proof.

In 1995 I started to work on "writing the proof down".
I had the first preprint available in June of 1995.

But it was only the beginning of the story of my proof of Milnor's Conjecture.

- You can see how the dynamic of the work of real mathematics unfold in time.
  Ideally a mathematician prove theorems, but you will see how it really goes.

  Remember that I got the proof at 1995, but got my Fields Medal in 2002.

The proof that I found depend on another conjecture.
That conjecture was in itself very cool and connected two areas of mathematics
which were at that time very far apart.

I was also sure that I know how to prove this conjecture,
but I know it will take long time.

Then I started to look for a modification of the first proof,
to make it not depend on the new conjecture.
About a year later I found it.
I wrote preprint with the new proof in December 1996.
The proof in the preprint contained all the main ideas
but many details were left out.

And then it took me 7 years to work out these details
and to publish a paper with a complete proof ...

------

And I was lucky!

The ideas which the proof was based on turned out to be solid
and the results of other people which I relied on turned out to be correct.

This is not always the case.

Let me tell you the story of another of my proofs which turned out very differently.

------

In 1987, I was introduced to Mikhail Kapranov.
I was an undergrad at Moscow University and he was a graduate student.

We immediately discovered that we are both dreaming of
developing new "higher dimensional" mathematics
inspired by the concepts of higher category theory.

We started to work together.
It was great fun.
Doing mathematics with someone from whom you can learn,
while discovering together things which are new both for you and for the world
is an amazing and powerful experience.
