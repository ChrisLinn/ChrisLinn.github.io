# C System

## Terminology

The C System was introduced by John Cartmell under the name "contextual categories",
but since the algebraic structure so introduced is not invariant under equivalences of categories.
The Terminology "pre-category" and "C System" was suggested by Vladimir Voevodsky.

## [John Cartmell] [1985] Generalised algebraic theories and contextual categories

  This paper revises John Cartmell's 1978 thesis.

### 1. Introduction

- **[Xie]**
  The aim of this paper is to provide semantics to type theories by constructing algebraic structures.
  Such semantics if developed can guide the implementation of type theories.

  Given a syntactic theory (or say, logical deduction system) (such as type theory),
  we wish to find an algebraic structure as its model.

Example relationship between syntactic theory and algebraic structure,

- Propositional Theory of Classical Logic and Boolean Algebra,
- Propositional Theory of Intuitionistic Logic and Heyting Algebra,
- Single Sorted Algebraic Theory and Lawvere's notion of an Algebraic Theory,
- Equational Theory of the language of the typed lambda-calculus and Cartesian Closed Category,
- Theory of Higher Order Intuitionistic Logic and Topos,
- Coherent Theory and Grothendieck Site,

in each case there can be defined the notion of model of a given theory in a given structure,
and thus the structures provide a semantics for the theories.
