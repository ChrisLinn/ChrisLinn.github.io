Definition of C-systems.

A C-system -- C, is a collection of data of the following form,

- (1) A set-level category (`object_t(C)`, `morphism_t(X, Y)`)
  - "set-level" means we care about equality instead of isomorphism between elements of set.
- (2) A function `length : object_t(C) -> nat_t`
- (3) An object `point : object_t(C)`
- (4) A map `father : object_t(C) -> object_t(C)`
