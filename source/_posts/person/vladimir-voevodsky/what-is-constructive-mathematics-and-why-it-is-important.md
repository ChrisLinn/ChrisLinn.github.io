When we say "constructive mathematics" we should first make clear
what we mean by the word "mathematics" in this phrase.

I am by training and by most of my life experience a pure mathematician.

For me to do mathematics means to invent or learn mathematical constructions
and then to use them to prove theorems that answer questions
that has been posed by other, mostly, more senior mathematicians.

- It is a kind of self-perpetuating activity,
  where we build on what our precursors have built.

- Starting from this view, one can realize the importance of correctness in mathematics,
  because we are building on what the previous generations have built,
  it is very important what they have built is actually correct,
  otherwise if someone discovers a mistake in something which has been done three generations ago,
  then so much have already been built upon it,
  it will lead to very big crash.

  We haven't so far experienced crashes of such big effects,
  but I have observed smaller crashes which destroy good mathematicians,
  because they built upon mistakes of previous generations,
  and they have advertise what they have built as a solution of Fermat's Last Conjecture,
  so the person was going to various forums and reporting the solution of the conjecture,
  until some people found something strange in what he was saying.
  Eventually he was made to look into the proof of the results
  which was published in a referee journal which he refered to.
  The proof turned out to be nonsense, and all his constructions failed.

  He is a friend of mine, it's no joke to me.
  It happend ten years ago, and he still can not get himself back into normal existence.

  So the correctness is extremely important.

  That is the road from which I came to the questions
  such as why constructive mathematics is important.

Therefore, mathematics for me consist of definitions and constructions,
assertions about these constructions and proofs of these assertions.
