First, let me state the following over simplified, but, I believe,
important for the understanding thesis:

> The main idea of the Univalent Foundations is how to
>   interpret type-theoretic universe mathematically.

In answering this question I was strongly influenced by the
paper of M. Makkai "First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts,
with Applications to Category Theory". There Makkai
discusses What he sees as the future foundations of mathematics
and even give them a name: "Invariant Foundations".

This is the break through point of the development of Univalent Foundations,
No we do not need categories, we only need groupoids.

Categories are great, but categories are basically
higher level analogs of partially ordered sets.
Partially ordered sets are also great,
but it is the sets that are fundamental,
partially ordered sets are just one of the possible structures
which one can endow sets with.

Groupoids are fundamental because they are homotopy types.
