First, let me state the following over simplified, but, I believe,
important for the understanding thesis:

> The main idea of the Univalent Foundations is how to
>   interpret type-theoretic universe mathematically.

In answering this question I was strongly influenced by the
paper of M. Makkai "First Order Logic with Dependent Sorts,
with Applications to Category Theory". There Makkai
discusses What he sees as the future foundations of mathematics
and even give them a name: "Invariant Foundations".

He then writes:

> The universe of the Invariant Foundation is not clearly defined yet,
> it should contain ana-n-categories for all natural n's;
> the the totality of ana-n-categories, with their morphisms, etc.,
> will form a ana-n+1-category.

- He basically means the foundations should be infinity-category of infinity-categories.

It is a very natural idea and it took me a lot of effort to understand that
it is **wrong** and that the universe of the new foundations of mathematics
should not be infinity-category of infinity-categories
but instead the infinity-groupoid of infinity-groupoids and their equivalences.

- This is the break through point of the development of Univalent Foundations,
  No, we do not need categories, we only need groupoids.

  Categories are great, but categories are basically
  higher level analogs of partially ordered sets.

  Partially ordered sets are also great,
  but it is the sets that are fundamental,
  while partially ordered sets are just one of the possible structures
  which one can endow sets with.

  The same is true here,
  it is the homotopy types that are fundamental,
  while category is just one possible structure
  which one can endow homotopy types with.

  Groupoids are fundamental because they are homotopy types.

Unlike infinity-categories, which we still do not understand well,
the infinity-groupoids are easy to understand
due to the reversal of an idea of Grothendieck:

> ... the intuition appeared that infinity-groupoids should constitute
> particularly adequate models for homotopy types,
> the n-groupoids corresponding to truncated homotopy types
> (with `pi(i) = 0` for `i > n`).
> -- Esquisse d'un Programme 1984

- The program that Grothendieck proposed is not found,
  but it is one of the most fruitful paper over the last 50 years.

- Homotopy types are easy to understand
  because they can be understood by topological spaces.

------

According to this "Grothendieck correspondence",
infinity-groupoids are models of homotopy types.

Hence, there should be a homotopy type corresponding to
the infinity-groupoid of infinity-groupoids and their equivalences.

- The universe we are searching.

What is it?
