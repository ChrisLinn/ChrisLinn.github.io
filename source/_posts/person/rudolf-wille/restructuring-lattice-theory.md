# Restructuring lattice theory: an approach based on hierarchies of concepts

## Abstract

Lattice theory today reflects the general status of current
mathematics: there is a rich production of theoretical concepts,
results, and developments, many of which are reached by elaborate
mental gymnastics; on the other hand, the connections of the
theory to its surroundings are getting weaker and weaker, with
the result that the theory and even many of its parts become more
isolated. Restructuring lattice theory is an attempt to reinvig-
orate connections with our general culture by interpreting the
theory as concretely as possible, and in this way to promote
better communication between lattice theorists and potential users
of lattice theory.

The approach reported here goes back to the origin of the
lattice concept in nineteenth-century attempts to formalize
logic, where a fundamental step was the reduction of a concept
to its "extent".

  The 'reduction of a concept to its "extent"' might denote set theory.

We propose to make the reduction less abstract
by retaining in some measure the "intent" of a concept.

# 1 Restructuring lattice theory

Lattice theory today reflects the general status of current
mathematics: there is a rich production of theoretical concepts,
results, and developments, many of which are reached by elaborate
mental gymnastics; on the other hand, the connections of the
theory to its surroundings are getting weaker: the result is
that the theory and even many of its parts become more isolated.

- **[Xie]**
  We need to restructuring other theories of mathematics.

This is not only a problem of lattice theory or of mathematics.
Many sciences suffer from this effect of specialization.

Scientists and philosophers are, of course,
aware of the danger of this growing isolation.
