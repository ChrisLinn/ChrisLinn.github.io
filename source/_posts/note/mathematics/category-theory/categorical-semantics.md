We need categorical semantics to be able to prove
things about the languages we designed.

If we implement category theory in our language,
then the denotational semantics is just
a interpreter implemented by the category theory.

It was found that the connectives of pre-categorical logic
were more clearly understood using the concept of adjoint functor,
and that the quantifiers were also best understood using adjoint functors.
