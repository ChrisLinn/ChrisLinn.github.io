# Modal Logic

## As extension of propositional logic

We add `#(P)` -- `box(P)` and `$(P)` -- `diamond(P)`.
We have `~(#(P)) == $(~(P))` and `~($(P)) == #(~(P))`,
where `~(P)` means `not(P)`.

## Kinds of modal logics

Different interpretation of the modal operators `#` and `$`.

| logics    | modality                |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| alethic   | necessary, possible     |
| deontic   | obligatory, permissible |
| temporal  | always                  |
| epistemic | known                   |
| doxastic  | believed                |
