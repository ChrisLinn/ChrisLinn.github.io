# Ones Inner Universe

------

I am Xie Yuheng, an independent Chinese researcher in Foundations of Mathematics.

The area of my inquiry is beautifully formulated by [Vladimir Voevodsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Voevodsky) as following,

> A formal deduction system together with a correspondence
> between its components and objects and actions in the world of mathematical thoughts
> which can be used to formalize all subject areas of mathematics
> is called a foundational system for mathematics or "Foundations of Mathematics".

I design programming languages
and use them as formal deduction systems
to formalize areas of mathematics which I am interested in.

I am specially interested in formalization of [Algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology),
(I am trying to find an algebraic definition of infinity groupoids
that would satisfy the Grothendieck correspondence.)
and its applications in [Geometric modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_modeling).

I am also specially interested in formalization of [Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory),
and its applications in the design of programming languages' type systems.
(Which relates back to my language designs.)
This kind of applications are called [Categorical semantics](https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/categorical+semantics) or [Categorical logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_logic).
(It is called "Categorical logic" because type systems are equivalent to logic deduction systems.)

I am also interested in formalization of [Lattice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice_(order)),
and its applications in [formal concept analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_concept_analysis).
