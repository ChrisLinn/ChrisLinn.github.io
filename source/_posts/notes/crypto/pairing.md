## Assumption
The security of many pairing-based protocols is dependent on the intractability
of the following problem.

Let $n$ be a prime number. Let $G_1$ = $<Pi>$ be an additively-written group of
order $n$ with identity ∞, and let GT be a multiplicatively-written group of order $n$
with identity 1.
