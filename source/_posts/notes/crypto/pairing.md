## Assumption
Let $n$ be a prime number. Let $G_1$ = $\langle P \rangle$ be an additively-written group of order $n$ with identity $\infty$, and let $G_T$ be a multiplicatively-written group of order $n$ with identity 1.

The security of many pairing-based protocols is dependent on the intractability
of the following problem.

Let $\hat{e}$ be a bilinear pairing on $(G_1, G_T)$. The **bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem** (BDHP) is the following: Given $P, aP, bP, cP$, compute $\hat{e}(P, P)^{abc}$.
