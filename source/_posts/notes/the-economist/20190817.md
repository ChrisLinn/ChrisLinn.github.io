## The world economy: Markets in an Age of Anxiety

> A dozen years ago, investors were complacent about the risk of recession. Not any more

However, the dominant mood in markets today, as it has been for much of the past decade, is not complacency but anxiety. And it is deepening by the day.

然而，今天市场中的主导情绪，就像过去十年的大部分时间一样，不是自满而是焦虑。而且这一天正在加深。

It is most evident in the astounding appetite for the safest of assets: government bonds. In Germany, where figures this week showed that the economy is shrinking, interest rates are negative all the way from overnight deposits to 30-year bonds. Investors who buy and hold bonds to maturity will make a guaranteed cash loss. In Switzerland negative yields extend all the way to 50-year bonds. Even in indebted and crisis-prone Italy, a ten-year bond gets you only 1.5%. In America, meanwhile, the curve is inverted—interest rates on ten-year bonds are lower than on three-month bills—a peculiar situation that is a harbinger of recession. Angst is evident elsewhere, too. The safe-haven dollar is up against many other currencies. Gold is at a six-year high. Copper prices, a proxy for industrial health, are down sharply. Despite Iran’s seizure of oil tankers in the Gulf, oil prices have sunk to $60 a barrel.

最明显的是对最安全资产的惊人需求：政府债券。在德国，本周的数据显示经济正在萎缩，从隔夜存款到30年期债券的利率一路走低。购买和持有债券到期的投资者将获得有保证的现金损失。在瑞士，负收益率一直延续至50年期债券。即使在债务危机和意外危机的情况下，十年期债券也只能获得1.5％。与此同时，在美国，曲线反转 - 十年期债券的利率低于三个月的债券 - 这是一个特殊情况，预示着经济衰退。Angst在其他地方也很明显。避险美元兑许多其他货币上涨。黄金价格处于六年高位。作为工业健康代表的铜价大幅下跌。

Plenty of people fear that these strange signals portend a global recession. The storm clouds are certainly gathering. This week China said that industrial production is growing at its most sluggish pace since 2002. America’s decade-long expansion is the oldest on record so, whatever economists say, a downturn feels overdue. With interest rates already so low, the capacity to fight one is depleted. Investors fear that the world is turning into Japan, with a torpid economy that struggles to vanquish deflation, and is hence prone to going backwards.

很多人担心这些奇怪的信号预示着全球经济衰退。风暴云无疑正在聚集。本周中国表示工业生产正以自2002年以来最缓慢的速度增长。美国长达十年之久的扩张是历史最悠久的，所以无论经济学家怎么说，经济衰退都是过期的。由于利率已经如此之低，打击利率的能力已经耗尽。投资者担心世界正在转向日本，其经济形势正在努力克服通货紧缩，因此很容易倒退。

Yet a recession is so far a fear, not a reality. The world economy is still growing, albeit at a less healthy pace than in 2018. Its resilience rests on consumers, not least in America. Jobs are plentiful; wages are picking up; credit is still easy; and cheaper oil means there is more money to spend. What is more, there has been little sign of the heady exuberance that normally precedes a slump. The boards of public companies and the shareholders they ostensibly serve have played it safe. Businesses in aggregate are net savers. Investors have favoured firms that generate cash without needing to splurge on fixed assets. You see this in the vastly contrasting fortunes of America’s high-flying stockmarket, dominated by capital-light internet and services firms that throw off profits, and Europe’s, groaning under banks and under carmakers with factories that eat up capital. And within Europe’s stockmarkets a defensive stock, such as Nestlé, is trading at a towering premium to an industrial one such as Daimler.

然而，经济衰退到目前为止仍是一种恐惧，而非现实。世界经济仍在增长，尽管其增长速度不如2018年。其适应力依赖于消费者，尤其是美国。工作很充足; 工资上涨; 信用仍然很容易; 而且更便宜的石油意味着有更多的钱可以花。更重要的是，通常在经济衰退之前没有出现令人兴奋的繁荣的迹象。上市公司的董事会和他们表面上所服务的股东都是安全的。总体而言，企业是净储蓄者。投资者一直青睐能够产生现金而不需要挥霍固定资产的公司。你可以在美国高速飞涨的股票市场中看到这一点，这个股票由资本轻盈的互联网和服务公司主导，这些公司甩掉了利润，欧洲的，在银行和汽车制造商的呻吟下，工厂耗尽了资金。在欧洲的股票市场中，像雀巢这样的防御性股票的交易价格远高于像戴姆勒这样的工业股票。

If there has been no boom and the world economy has not yet turned to bust, why then are markets so anxious? The best answer is that firms and markets are struggling to get to grips with uncertainty. This, not tariffs, is the greatest harm from the trade war between America and China. The boundaries of the dispute have stretched from imports of some industrial metals to broader categories of finished goods (see article). New fronts, including technology supply-chains and, this month, currencies, have opened up. As Japan and South Korea let their historical differences spill over into trade, it is unclear who or what might be drawn in next. Because big investments are hard to reverse, firms are disinclined to press ahead with them. A proxy measure from JPMorgan Chase suggests that global capital spending is now falling. Evidence that investment is being curtailed is reflected in surveys of plunging business sentiment, in stalling manufacturing output worldwide and in the stuttering performance of industry-led economies, not least Germany.

如果没有繁荣，世界经济还没有转向破产，为什么市场如此焦虑呢？最好的答案是公司和市场正在努力克服不确定性。这不是关税，是中美之间贸易战的最大危害。争议的界限已经从一些工业金属的进口扩展到更广泛的成品类别（见文章））。包括技术供应链和本月货币在内的新战线已经开放。由于日本和韩国将其历史差异扩散到贸易中，目前尚不清楚接下来可能会吸引谁或者什么。由于大投资很难逆转，企业不愿意继续推进这些投资。摩根大通（JPMorgan Chase）的一项代理措施表明全球资本支出正在下降。投资受到限制的证据反映在对商业情绪暴跌，全球制造业产出停滞以及行业主导经济体（尤其是德国）的口吃表现的调查中。

Central banks are anxious, too, and easing policy as a result. In July the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates for the first time in a decade as insurance against a downturn. It is likely to follow that with more cuts. Central banks in Brazil, India, New Zealand, Peru, the Philippines and Thailand have all reduced their benchmark interest rates since the Fed acted. The European Central Bank is likely to resume its bond-buying programme.

中央银行也很焦虑，结果也放松了政策。7月份美联储十年来首次降低利率作为对抗经济衰退的保险。随着更多削减，可能会采取这种做法。自美联储采取行动以来，巴西，印度，新西兰，秘鲁，菲律宾和泰国的中央银行都降低了基准利率。欧洲央行可能会恢复其债券购买计划。

Despite these efforts, anxiety could turn to alarm, and sluggish growth descend into recession. Three warning signals are worth watching. First, the dollar, which is a barometer of risk appetite. The more investors reach for the safety of the greenback, the more they see danger ahead. Second come the trade negotiations between America and China. This week President Donald Trump unexpectedly delayed the tariffs announced on August 1st on some imports, raising hopes of a deal. That ought to be in his interests, as a strong economy is critical to his prospects of re-election next year. But he may nevertheless be misjudging the odds of a downturn. Mr Trump may also find that China decides to drag its feet, in the hope of scuppering his chances of a second term and of getting a better deal (or one likelier to stick) with his Democratic successor.

尽管做出了这些努力，焦虑可能会变得震惊，而缓慢的增长也会陷入衰退。三个警告信号值得关注。首先是美元，这是风险偏好的晴雨表。投资者对美元的安全性越多，他们就越能看到危险。其次是中美贸易谈判。本周，唐纳德特朗普总统意外地推迟了8月1日宣布的部分进口关税，从而提高了对交易的希望。这应该符合他的利益，因为强大的经济对他明年再次当选的前景至关重要。但他可能会误判经济衰退的可能性。特朗普先生也可能会发现中国决定拖延他的脚步，希望能够破坏他第二个任期的机会，并与他的民主党继任者达成更好的协议（或者更有可能坚持下去）。

The third thing to watch is corporate-bond yields in America. Financing costs remain remarkably low. But the spread—or extra yield—that investors require to hold risker corporate debt has begun to widen. If growing anxiety were to cause spreads to blow out, highly geared firms would find it costlier to roll over their debt. That could lead them to cut back on payrolls as well as investment in order to make their interest payments. The odds of a recession would then shorten.

第三件事是美国的企业债券收益率。融资成本仍然非常低。但投资者要求持有风险企业债务的利差或额外收益率已经开始扩大。如果日益增长的焦虑导致利差扩大，那么高杠杆率的公司会发现偿还债务会更加昂贵。这可能导致他们削减工资和投资，以便支付利息。经济衰退的可能性随之缩短。

When people look back, they will find plenty of inconsistencies in the configuration of today’s asset prices. The extreme anxiety in bond markets may come to look like a form of recklessness: how could markets square the rise in populism with a fear of deflation, for instance? It is a strange thought that a sudden easing of today’s anxiety might lead to violent price changes—a surge in bond yields; a sideways crash in which high-priced defensive stocks slump and beaten-up cyclicals rally. Eventually there might even be too much exuberance. But just now, who worries about that?

当人们回顾过去时，他们会发现今天资产价格的配置存在很多不一致之处。债券市场的极端焦虑可能看起来像是一种鲁莽的形式：例如，市场如何通过担心通货紧缩来推动民粹主义的崛起？一种奇怪的想法是，突然放松今天的焦虑可能导致价格剧烈变化 - 债券收益率飙升; 一场横盘大跌，其中高价的防御性股票暴跌，并打击了周期性反弹。最终甚至可能会有太多的繁荣。但就在此，谁担心呢？

> The world’s monetary system is breaking down 全球货币体系正在瓦解，前景不明

...

International trade is complicated by the fact that most countries have their own currencies, which move in idiosyncratic ways and can be held down to boost competitiveness. Governments’ efforts to manage currencies are constrained by certain trade-offs. Pegging them to an external anchor to stabilise their value means either ceding control of domestic economic policy or restricting access to foreign capital flows. Systems of monetary order, which resolve these trade-offs in one way as opposed to another, work until they do not. The context for America’s economic showdown with China is a system that worked once but no longer does.

大多数国家都有自己的货币，变动走势各不相同，可以人为让货币贬值以提高本国竞争力，因此国际贸易非常复杂。政府管理货币时要权衡各种利害得失。把货币与外部的锚挂钩以稳定其价值意味着要么放弃对本国经济政策的控制，要么限制外国资本流入。货币秩序体系会用非此即彼的方式来解决这些需要权衡的问题，直至体系失效。美国与中国经济对峙的背后就是一个曾经有效但如今已不再管用的体系。

Such things happen. The first great age of globalisation, which began in the late 19th century, was built atop the gold standard. Governments fixed the value of their currencies to gold, sacrificing some control over the domestic economy. This trade-off became untenable during the Great Depression, when governments reneged on their monetary commitments. As one after another devalued, angry trading partners put up tariffs, and the world retreated into rival currency blocs. In 1944 Allied nations had another go at crafting a monetary order at a conference in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire. Participating countries fixed their currencies to the dollar (with some room for adjustment). The buck, in turn, was pegged to gold. The truce survived a mere quarter-century. As America’s trade balance sagged and inflation rose in the 1960s and 1970s, faith in the dollar’s peg to gold waned. Drastic fiscal and monetary belt-tightening might have restored its credibility abroad, but at great cost at home. Forced to choose between the domestic interest and the survival of the global monetary system, Nixon abandoned America’s Bretton Woods commitments.

这样的事情时有发生。全球化的第一个大时代始于19世纪后期，建立在金本位之上。政府把本国货币锚定黄金，牺牲了对国内经济的部分掌控。在大萧条期间，当政府背弃其货币承诺时，这种取舍就无法再维持了。随着一国又一国贬值本国货币，愤怒的贸易伙伴纷纷提高关税，世界又重新分裂为互相竞争的货币集团。1944年，同盟国在新罕布什尔州的布雷顿森林举行会议，再次尝试打造货币秩序。与会国将其货币与美元挂钩（留有一定的调整空间），美元则与黄金挂钩。风平浪静的日子仅持续了四分之一个世纪。上世纪六七十年代，随着美国贸易失衡，通胀上升，对美元与黄金挂钩的信心逐渐减弱。激进的财政和货币紧缩政策可能在国外挽回了公信力，但国内却承担了巨大的代价。尼克松被迫在国内利益和维系全球货币体系之间做出选择。他选择了放弃美国的布雷顿森林承诺。

The present system, often described as Bretton Woods II, slowly emerged from the ashes of the post-war order. The dollar’s dominance did not end. Much of the world’s commerce trades in greenbacks. Changes in America’s economic policy still echo around the world. A stronger dollar depresses global trade, research suggests, while tighter American monetary policy straitens global financial conditions. Through bitter experience, emerging economies learnt that protecting themselves against these gales meant accumulating large dollar reserves, which began to pile up in the 1990s and peaked in 2014. Emerging-market dollar purchases kept the greenback overvalued and boosted the competitiveness of emerging-market exporters. America began running large, persistent current-account deficits. In other words, its excessive consumption was funded by lending from the emerging world, which invested its dollars into American assets. This flow of money—from reserve-accumulating economies, China chief among them, to America, and from American consumers back to reserve-accumulating economies—defined Bretton Woods II.

现行体系常被称作布雷顿森林体系2.0，是从战后秩序的灰烬中慢慢建立起来的。美元的主导地位仍未终结。全球大部分贸易都以美元结算。美国经济政策的变化仍然影响世界各地。研究表明，美元走强会抑制全球贸易，而美国收紧货币政策会令全球金融收紧。有了痛苦的经历，新兴经济体明白了要保护自己免受金融风暴的影响，就要积累大量美元储备。它们在上世纪90年代开始累积储备，到2014年达到了顶峰。新兴市场购进美元使美元被持续高估，并提高了本国的出口竞争力。美国开始出现持续的巨额经常账户赤字。换句话说，美国的过度消费是从新兴市场借钱支撑的，后者用美元投资美国资产。资金从以中国为主的一批累积储备的经济体流向美国，再从美国消费者的口袋流回这些经济体，这样的货币流动就是布雷顿森林体系2.0的根本。
