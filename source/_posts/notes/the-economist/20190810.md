## US-China trade: Dangerous miscalculations

> Other rich countries do not have frequent mass shootings. There is a simple reason for that

SINCE THE trade war began in 2018 the damage done to the global economy has been surprisingly slight. America has grown healthily and the rest of the world has muddled along. But this week the picture darkened as the confrontation between America and China escalated, with more tariffs threatened and a bitter row erupting over China’s exchange rate. Investors fear the dispute will trigger a recession, and there are ominous signs in the markets—share prices fell and government-bond yields sank to near-record lows. To avoid a downturn, both sides need to compromise. But for that to happen President Donald Trump and his advisers must rethink their strategy. If the realisation has not dawned yet, it soon should: America cannot have a cheap currency, a trade conflict and a thriving economy.

自2018年开战以来，贸易战对全球经济的破坏程度之轻令人惊讶。美国经济健康增长，世界其他地区也还算过得去。但局势在上周变得更加晦暗，中美之间的对抗升级，美国威胁开征更多关税，人民币汇率也引发了激烈的争吵。投资者担心这些争端将引发经济衰退，市场也出现了不祥迹象——股价下跌，政府债券收益率跌至接近历史低点。为避免经济滑坡，双方都需要妥协。但要实现这一点，特朗普总统及其顾问就必须重新考虑他们的战略。有一件事如果他们还没有领悟，那也应该快了：美国无法同时拥有廉价货币、贸易冲突和繁荣的经济。

...

There is no denying that China has manipulated its exchange rate in the past. But today a different dynamic is playing out around the world. Mr Trump wants a booming economy, protected by tariffs and boosted by a cheap dollar, and when he doesn’t get them he lashes out. But economic reality makes these three objectives hard to reconcile. Tariffs hurt foreign exporters and dampen growth beyond America’s borders; weaker growth in turn leads to weaker currencies, as business becomes cautious and central banks ease policy in response. The effect is particularly pronounced when America is growing faster than other rich countries, as it has recently. The dollar’s enduring strength is a result, in part, of Mr Trump’s policies, not of a global conspiracy.

无可否认，中国过去确实操纵过汇率。但眼下世界各地的形势有所不同。特朗普想要受关税保护和廉价美元推动的繁荣经济，如果没有实现就大加挞伐。但经济现实使这三个目标难以调和。关税损害了外国出口商，抑制了美国之外其他地区的增长；疲弱的增长反过来导致货币走软，因为企业会变得谨慎，而央行会放松政策作为应对。当美国的增长速度超过其他富裕国家时，这种影响尤为明显，最近就是这种情况。美元持续走强部分是因为特朗普的政策，而不是全球阴谋。

Unless this fact sinks in soon, real harm will be done to the global economy. Faced with the uncertainty created by a vicious superpower brawl, firms in America and elsewhere are cutting investment, hurting growth further. Lower interest rates are making Europe’s rickety banks even more fragile. China could face a destabilising flood of money trying to leave its borders, as happened in 2015. And further escalation is possible as both sides reach for economic weapons that were considered unthinkable a few years ago. America could intervene to weaken the dollar, undermining its reputation for unfettered capital markets. China or America could impose sanctions on more of each other’s multinational firms, in the same way that America has blacklisted Huawei, or suspend the licences of banks that operate in both countries, causing havoc.

除非特朗普很快领悟这一事实，否则将对全球经济造成真正的损害。面对超级大国的恶毒争吵带来的不确定性，美国和其他地方的公司正在削减投资，进一步损害经济增长。较低的利率使得欧洲摇摇欲坠的银行更加脆弱。中国可能面临资金外逃引发不稳定，就像2015年发生过的那样。随着双方诉诸几年前被认为是不可想象的经济武器，局势还可能进一步升级。美国可以做出干预让美元贬值，从而损害其自由资本市场的声誉。中国或美国可以对彼此更多的跨国公司实施制裁，就像美国将华为列入黑名单那样，或是吊销同时在两国经营的银行的许可证，造成大破坏。

## Currency wars: The guns of August

> America brands China a currency manipulator, and global markets swoon

...

This marked the end of investors’ hopes for a peaceful summer. At the end of July the Federal Reserve had cut interest rates to guard against a slowdown in America’s respectable growth rate, and trade tensions had “returned to a simmer”, as Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chair, noted with satisfaction. But after the yuan’s move America’s stockmarket suffered its worst day this year. Emerging-market currencies, including the Brazilian real, Indian rupee and South African rand, fell. The price of Brent crude oil tumbled below $60 a barrel and safe havens, such as gold, rallied. The same search for safety pushed American ten-year government bond yields to 1.7%, as investors bet that the Fed would be forced to slash interest rates further to prevent a recession. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand cut its benchmark interest rate by twice as much as expected, citing “heightened uncertainty” and “historically low” global bond yields. The Australian dollar fell to its lowest level in a decade.

投资者安度今夏的期望就此破灭。7月底，美联储降低利率以防止美国不俗的经济增长势头走低，美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔（Jerome Powell）志得意满地指出贸易冲突已“降为小火”。但就在人民币贬值后，美国股市创下年内最大单日跌幅。巴西雷亚尔、印度卢比、南非兰特等新兴市场货币的汇率纷纷下跌。布伦特原油价格跌破每桶60美元，黄金等避险工具价格上升。同样的求稳心理还把美国十年期国债收益率推低至1.7％，因为投资者认为美联储将被迫进一步降息以防经济衰退。新西兰央行下调基准利率的幅度是人们预测的两倍，原因是“不确定性增加”以及全球债券收益率触及“历史新低”。澳元跌至十年来最低水平。

In matters of war and peace, countries must prepare for the worst. But precautions can look like provocations. In allowing the yuan to fall, China signalled it is prepared for a protracted trade war. It let the yuan weaken in response to the threat of tariffs much as a floating currency would. Otherwise it would have needed to defend an arbitrary line against the dollar every time America turned belligerent. Its move nonetheless makes further belligerence more probable. Mr Trump is now unlikely to change his mind about the new tariffs before they kick in on September 1st.

在战争与和平的问题上，各国必须为最坏的情况做好准备。但防御措施也有可能被看成挑衅。中国让人民币贬值，这表明它准备好打一场持久的贸易战。它让人民币贬值来应对加征关税的威胁，就像汇率浮动的货币会自然发生的那样。否则，每次美国进逼来犯，它都得守卫那条不无随机性的汇率底线。然而，此举可能令美国变得更加杀气腾腾。现在看来，9月1日新关税实施之前，特朗普已不太可能回心转意。

...

To support a slowing economy, China’s government has already cut taxes, increased infrastructure spending and relented in its campaign to restrain credit growth. But it is reluctant to boost the property market, which helped pull the economy out of previous slowdowns, points out Andrew Batson of Gavekal, a research firm. House prices have risen mercilessly and developers have accumulated worrying levels of debt. China, in short, wants to keep growth stable, stand up to America in the trade war and constrain excesses in the housing market. It is becoming harder to do all those things at once.

为撑起正在放缓的经济，中国政府已经推出了减税政策，增加了基础设施支出，还放松了之前抑制信贷增长的措施。但研究公司Gavekal的安德鲁·巴特森（Andrew Batson）指出，尽管房地产市场过去多次帮助中国避免了经济衰退，但这次中国并不愿意提振楼市。房价已经升得过高，而开发商的负债水平令人担忧。简而言之，中国希望保持稳定增长，在贸易战中力抗美国，并抑制楼市过热。但要同时做到这些变得越来越难。

The damage to America’s economy is less tangible. A survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggested that tariffs and trade-war uncertainty had hurt private investment by 1.2% (and manufacturing investment by over 4%). The unease has also made it harder for the Fed both to preserve stable growth and to raise interest rates to more normal levels. That will give it less room to act if the economy flounders for other reasons.

美国经济受到的破坏更不易察觉。亚特兰大联邦储备银行的一项调查显示，关税和贸易战的不确定性已导致私人投资减少1.2％（制造业投资减少了4％以上）。这种不安也使美联储更难在保持经济稳定增长的同时把利率恢复到更正常的水平。如果美国经济因其他问题陷入困境，调整的空间会变得更小。

In a tweet, Mr Trump called on the Fed to respond to China’s weakening currency. Although the dollar is technically the responsibility of America’s Treasury, the Fed’s decisions have a profound influence over its value. It does not take orders from the president and treats the exchange rate with benign neglect. But if the uncertainties of the trade war inflict enough harm on confidence and spending, it might cut interest rates anyway. The futures market prices in a roughly 40% chance of at least 0.75 percentage points of easing by the year’s end. The fog of war can be as damaging as war itself.

特朗普在推特上呼吁美联储采取行动回应人民币贬值。虽然严格说来美元归美国财政部管，但美联储的决定对美元的价值有着深远影响。美联储不听命于美国总统，而且向来善意地忽视美元汇率。但如果贸易战的不确定性对信心和消费的损害达到一定程度，美联储可能还是会降息。期货市场的价格已经将年底前有40％的可能会至少降息0.75个百分点的预期考虑在内。战争的迷雾可能有着和战争一样的破坏性。

The trade fight has reverberated globally. America’s Treasury had already expanded the list of countries it is monitoring for signs of currency manipulation. None of the countries listed met all three of the Treasury’s criteria (a large bilateral surplus with America, a material overall surplus and persistent currency intervention by the central bank). But then, neither did China. The definition of manipulation is, it seems, highly manipulable.

中美贸易战在全球也产生了广泛影响。美国财政部已经扩大了汇率操纵国观察名单。名单上的所有国家都没有同时符合美国财政部定下的三项标准（对美有巨额双边贸易顺差、有巨额经常账户盈余、央行持续干预货币市场）。但中国也没有三项全中。对“操纵”的界定似乎是可以大加操纵的。

One of the currencies most affected has been Japan’s yen. A haven in troubled times, it rose sharply after Mr Trump’s surprise announcement. A strong yen makes it harder for Japan’s central bank to revive inflation, especially as its interest rates already lie below zero. Although Japan has not intervened directly in the currency markets since 2011, its officials are watching the yen’s rise with alarm. If the currency strengthens closer to the psychological threshold of 100 to the dollar, Japan’s authorities might feel compelled to act. Currency wars can also be the continuation of monetary policy by other means.

受影响最大的货币之一是日元。在特朗普突然宣布加征关税后，作为动荡时期避风港的日元飙升。日元走强使日本央行更难重振通胀，尤其是日本已处于负利率状态。虽然日本政府自2011年以来没有直接干预过货币市场，但日本官员现在正警觉地关注着日元升势，如果升值接近100日元兑一美元的心理关口，日本当局可能觉得必须要采取行动了。货币战也可能是货币政策的延续。

Nor has Europe escaped. Industrial production in Germany fell by 5.2% in the year to June. “Foreign macro shocks” account for about two-thirds of Germany’s slowdown since 2017, according to Goldman Sachs. European banks, including ABN AMRO, Commerzbank and UniCredit, this week warned of squeezed interest margins, rising provisions or flagging revenues. In a recent economic bulletin, the European Central Bank worried that trade uncertainty had delayed global investment, damaging European exports of manufacturing, machinery and transport equipment. In a globalised economy, everything is a continuation of everything else.■

欧洲也不能幸免。截至6月的一年里，德国工业产值下降了5.2％。根据高盛的数据，德国自2017年以来的经济放缓有约三分之二是“外国宏观冲击”造成的。荷兰银行、德国商业银行和裕信银行等欧洲银行上周警告，称未来可能出现利差缩窄、准备金率上升或收入下降的情况。欧洲央行在最近发布的一份经济公报中担忧贸易前景的不确定性已导致全球投资滞后，损害欧洲的制造业、机械和运输设备出口。在全球化经济中，一切都是其他一切的延续。


## Buttonwood: The meaning of seven

> China’s currency has “cracked seven”, prompting a share sell-off and bond rally

...

To understand why, go back four years. Until August 2015 the yuan had been closely tied to the dollar. Since then its external price has been set by officials each day, ostensibly by reference to a basket of currencies. The idea is that the yuan’s value should somewhat reflect market forces. The outcome is that the yuan has moved in a limited range against the dollar, capped at seven. Were the yuan to surge, it would hurt China’s exports; were it to plummet, the dollar debts of Chinese firms would loom larger. A large fall would intensify an ever-present fear: devaluation and capital flight.

要探讨原因，且回到四年前。2015年8月之前，人民币汇率一直与美元密切挂钩。而之后，人民币对外价格由官员每日设定，表面上是参考一篮子货币汇率。此举意在让人民币价值在一定程度上反映市场动态。其结果是人民币兑美元汇率一直在一定范围内浮动，上限为七。人民币如果大幅升值，则中国的出口受损；如果暴跌，则中国企业的美元债务会加重。汇率大幅下跌将加剧一直存在的恐慌：货币贬值和资本外逃。

The yuan is still a long way from being a free-floating currency. It is further away still from being a global one to rival the dollar. It is not a straightforward business to buy and sell yuan. Traders joke that it is less liquid than the shares of Alibaba, a giant Chinese e-commerce firm, which is listed in New York. Yet despite the constraints, the waxing and waning of the yuan’s value has had a growing influence on the foreign-exchange market and on asset prices more generally.

人民币还远不是汇率自由浮动的货币，更遑论能与美元竞争的全球性货币。买卖人民币并不是件简单直接的事情。交易员开玩笑说，人民币的流动性比中国电商巨头阿里巴巴的股票（在纽约上市）还要低。然而，尽管受到限制，人民币价值的涨跌对外汇市场和更广泛的资产价格的影响力日增。

This is in large part because the currencies of economies that do a lot of trade with China have tended to move in tandem with the yuan. Its clout owes much to China’s weight in the global economy, but also to its gravity in export markets. When the yuan moves, it imparts news about global trade. The message is quickly picked up by the currencies of other export-oriented economies, not only in Asia but in Europe too.

这在很大程度上是因为有大量对华贸易的经济体的货币往往与人民币同步涨跌。人民币的影响力主要归功于中国在全球经济及出口市场中的分量。人民币的涨跌会传递全球贸易动态的信息。而这些信息会被其他出口导向型经济体的货币迅速吸收，不仅在亚洲，在欧洲也一样。

It is not wholly surprising, then, that President Donald Trump’s trade war with China has bled into a conflict over the yuan-dollar exchange rate. Reports from China in recent months suggested that it had become a sticking point in the stalled trade negotiations. The governor of China’s central bank even dropped a public hint in June that there was no red line at seven. America’s treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, countered that if China gave up supporting the yuan, it might be interpreted as an attempt to weaken it. That is one reason why crossing seven caused such a fuss.

所以，特朗普发起的对华贸易战会蔓延到人民币兑美元的汇率之争也就不那么意外了。中国近几月的报道表明，汇率问题已成为贸易谈判僵局的一个胶着点。中国央行行长甚至在6月公开暗示人民币汇率没有所谓的“保七”红线。美国财政部长史蒂文·努钦（Steven Mnuchin）反驳说，如果中国政府放弃力保人民币，就可以解读为是企图引导人民币贬值。这也是“破七”引发如此轰动的原因之一。

But there are others. The yuan-dollar exchange rate has become a gauge of global risk appetite. A weak yuan is often associated with weakness in a host of other important currencies, including the euro. The result is a strong dollar. That in turn squeezes global credit, because many countries and companies beyond America’s borders borrow in dollars. One consequence is slower global GDP growth. Another is that money tends to flow out of riskier sorts of securities, such as stocks and emerging-market bonds, into safer assets such as Treasury bonds.

但也有其他原因。人民币兑美元汇率已成为全球风险偏好的衡量指标。人民币走弱通常与欧元等许多其他重要货币疲软有关。结果是美元走强。这反过来又令全球信贷受到挤压，因为美国以外的许多国家和公司是以美元借款的。后果之一是全球GDP增长放缓。另一影响是资金往往会从股票和新兴市场债券等较高风险的证券转移至美国国债等较安全的资产上。

Arbitrary numbers often take on a life of their own in financial markets. China bears some blame in this instance. It has a penchant for control and opaque policymaking. Left to their own devices, investors start to impute greater significance to key thresholds. Officials follow their lead. The markets had become used to the yuan trading in a familiar range. It is not clear what the new rules are. The only thing that is certain is that yuan-dollar remains the asset price to watch.■

在金融市场上，随机性数字常常变得非常重要。在眼下这个案例中，中国要负一定责任。中国政府惯于管控，决策过程也不透明。全凭自己摸索的投资者变得越来越看重一些所谓的关口。官员们也被牵着走。市场已经习惯人民币在熟悉的汇率幅度内交易，新规则是什么现在尚不清楚。唯一确定的是，人民币兑美元汇率仍会是备受关注的资产价格。
