## China’s economy: The other inversion 中国经济：另一种颠倒
> Though the trade war is hurting, officials are reluctant to unleash stimulus 经济增长放缓，官员处之泰然。是他们自负吗？

Mr Trump has crowed about the success of his tactics. “China has taken a very hard hit,” he said on August 26th at a news conference after the G7 summit in France. “They want to make a deal very badly.” But a more accurate reading of China’s policy stance is one of surprising calm in the face of the economic slowdown and, by extension, of stiffer resolve in the trade dispute.

特朗普志得意满地宣称自己的策略取得了成功。“中国受到了非常大的打击，”他在8月26日法国G7峰会后的新闻发布会上说，“他们非常急切地想与美国达成协议。”但是，对中国的政策姿态更准确的解读是官员们面对经济放缓出奇地冷静自若，并且在贸易争端中更加咬紧牙关。

The toll of tariffs on China’s economy is becoming more visible. Although exports to America account for just a small share of overall GDP, the uncertainty has bruised corporate confidence. Investment spending is on track to increase this year at its weakest pace in at least two decades. Factory prices have veered into deflation, a bad sign for industrial profits. Economists at Morgan Stanley, a bank, now forecast that Chinese growth will fall to 5.8% next year; previously they had expected 6.3%.

关税对中国经济的打击日益显现。虽然对美出口仅占中国GDP总量的一小部分，但关税带来的不确定性已经损伤了企业信心。按照目前的趋势，今年投资支出的增速将跌至至少20年来的最低水平。工厂交货价格已转向下跌，对工业利润来说是个糟糕的信号。摩根士丹利的经济学家现在预测明年中国经济增速将降至5.8％，而此前他们预计为6.3％。

In the past, whenever growth looked set to slow sharply, Chinese companies could count on a stimulus package to revive it. But this time officials have been much more restrained in their response, partly because of concern about adding to China’s hefty debt burden. On August 26th the central bank had a chance to lower funding costs for banks, but it refrained, bucking the global trend towards lower rates. On August 27th the State Council, or cabinet, issued an underwhelming 20-point plan to promote consumption. Some analysts had been hoping for targeted tax cuts or subsidies; instead, it made small-bore promises, such as more 24-hour convenience stores.

过去，每当增长看似即将急剧放缓时，中国企业都可以指望政府出台财政刺激计划重振经济。但这次官员们的反应较以往克制得多，部分原因是担心进一步加重中国本已沉重的债务负担。8月26日，央行原本可以调低银行的融资成本，但最终刹车，没有跟随全球下调利率的趋势。8月27日，国务院发布了令人兴味索然的20条措施以提振消费。之前一些分析人士一直希望政府推出有针对性的减税或补贴措施，而实际只迎来一些不疼不痒的承诺，比如开设更多24小时便利店。

The Chinese government’s lack of panic about the economic outlook should give Mr Trump pause. “Its leadership now looks committed to a strategy of toughing out trade tensions,” says Andrew Batson of Gavekal, a research firm. It helps that China has procured insurance in letting its exchange rate decline to 7.1 yuan per dollar, the weakest since 2008, offsetting some of the drag from tariffs.

中国政府面对经济下行的前景不慌不忙，应该能让特朗普停下来想一想。研究公司Gavekal的安德鲁·巴森（Andrew Batson）说：“现在看来，中国领导层的战略是要在贸易争端中硬挺过去。”有助于此的是，作为保全之策，中国让人民币汇率降至7.1元兑一美元，是自2008年以来的最低点，部分抵消了关税带来的影响。

But some think the calm is verging on complacency. Not only has China’s government refrained from stimulus, but it has become more hawkish about the property sector, the engine of its economy. In line with President Xi Jinping’s oft-repeated warning that investors should not speculate on housing, regulators have curtailed lending to developers and sworn off cutting mortgage rates. “We would view stabilising growth by choking credit to the property sector as analogous to performing cardiac surgery without blood pumps, oxygen and anaesthesia,” says Lu Ting, an economist with Nomura, a bank. In other words, things could get ugly. ■

但有人认为这种平静近乎安于现状。中国政府不仅没有采取刺激措施，还更加强硬地打压房地产这一经济引擎。习近平一再警告投资者不应投机炒房，遵照这一指示，监管机构已限制向开发商放贷，并承诺不再降低房贷利率。“我们认为，以扼杀房地产行业信贷来稳定增长，就跟不用血泵、氧气和麻醉来做心脏手术一样。”投资银行野村证券的经济学家陆挺表示。换句话说，情况可能会变得很糟。
