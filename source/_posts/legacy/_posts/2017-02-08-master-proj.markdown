# 20170208
+ Gonna work on project now. And Renlord is not only nice but also funny I think. 
+ Should decide my topic as soon as possible if I wanna get my proposal done by week 1 (Yes though Rahul says it's not that serious but I'd better have my proposal by week 1). And I'd better have a detailed plan.  
+ Renlord says we are going to work together. Not only is he helping me but also I am helping him. He hates JAVA. 
+ The things I am interested in
+ Attack.
+ maybe double-spend?
+ or 51%?
+ Anonymity.
+ xiaoliang
+ content
+ verify


# 20170209
+ just recall that Renlord said that security people get low-paid (unless you are super good)


# 20170211
+ Great, Renlord has sent me the reading list.
+ come up with a plan (but actually every time I am too optimistic)
+ decide the topic by next week (18/Feb/2017)
+ start writing proposal the following week (20/Feb/2017)

# 20170214
+ has finished allume ftp stuff, can start working on project reading list now.

# 20170219
+ downloaded the articles on reading list given by Renlord

# 20170310
+ too slowly reading!
+ sometimes it's interesting!
+ sometimes I'm too tense to fall asleep

# 20170317
+ 又改题了，改成了 taint detection
    * 本来还想说会不会太简单，Renlord 不会以为是 12.5 的 proj 吧
        - 结果发现一点都不简单，
+ 种下的苦果都得吃
    * bitcoin 的 guest lecturte 没去
        - 要看 master bitcoin 和 guest lecturte recoding
    * 不学 MapReduce 和 Hadoop， DA 哈哈哈哈哈
        - 我的天啦，Udaya 要我用这些
            + 好像还有 RAID
        - 不过应该是后面更大的东西，再说吧
+ 所以这周的任务是
    * 看 readings 和 recordings
    * 写 proposal
    * 看 API 然后想办法 extract useful info
        - 后面要考虑放到 db 后有效的 indexing
            + renlord 说 1s？ __到时千万确认一下__

# 20170320
+ archive some past todos
    * [x] decide the topic by next week, which is 18/Feb/2017
        - anonymous browsering
            + seems is not what i am looking for if everyone has exactly the same copy of Φ database
            + pruning
                * not good
        - git hosting
            + __store in every node?__ too big i think
            + pruning
                * not good
        - __double-spending attack__
            + simulation
            + how to prevent
    * [X] read wikipedia
    * [X] read Renlord reading list
    * [X] start writing proposal the following week (20/Feb/2017)
+ Renlord is right, I should find some open source APIs, in case that processing a large amount of data

# 20170323
+ Shit... Parsing on regtest `blk*.dat` seems not working
