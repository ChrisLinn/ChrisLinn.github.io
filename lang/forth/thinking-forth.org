#+title: thinking forth

* intro

* the philosophy of forth

*** intro

    - to compare and contrast Forth
      with these state-of-the-art programming principles.

*** an armchair history of software elegance

    - to outline a history of the tools and techniques
      for writing more elegant programs.

    - from assembly-language to "high-level-language",
      linear correspondence between source code
      and the resulting machine instructions,
      is changed to nonlinear syntax-dependent correspondence.

      this is widely considered to be an invaluable step
      in the progress of programming methodology.

      But as weâ€™ll see, the approach ultimately
      offers more restriction than freedom.

    - the idea of modules [function] having "one-entry, one-exit"
      is that you can unplug them,
      change their innards, and plug them back in,
      without screwing up the connections with the rest of the program.

*** the superficiality of structure

*** looking back, and forth

*** component programming

*** hide from whom ?

*** hiding the construction of data structures

*** but is it a high-level language ?

*** the language of design

*** the language of performance

*** summary

*** references

* preliminary design / decomposition

* detailed design / problem solving

* implementation : elements of forth style

* factoring

* handling data : stacks and states
