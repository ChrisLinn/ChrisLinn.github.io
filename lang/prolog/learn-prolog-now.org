#+title: learn prolog now

* intro

  - fact rule query

  - variable unification

  - The business of unifying variables
    with information in the knowledge base
    is the heart of Prolog

  - As we’ll learn
    there are many interesting ideas in Prolog
    but when you get right down to it,
    it’s Prolog’s ability to perform unification
    and return the values of the variable bindings to us
    that is crucial

  - As we shall see,
    such nested (or recursively structured) terms
    enable us to represent many problems naturally.
    In fact the interplay between recursive term structure
    and variable unification
    is the source of much of Prolog’s power.
