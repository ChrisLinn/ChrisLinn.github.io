* non-euclidean-geometry (1942)

  - According to Klein,
    the character of any geometry is deterdetermined
    by the type of correspondence under which
    its relations are invariant.
    - euclidean geometry is invariant under similarity transformations.
    - algebraic topology is invariant under homotopy deformations.

    - point

      plane

    - incidence

    - collinear
      concurrent
      coplanar

    - Projective geometry may be described as
      the study of geometrical properties
      that are unchanged by "central projection".
