<li><p>
Digital computers, nowaday, are often viewed as so unhuman.
</p>

<p>
While actually, the abstract prototype of digital computer
&#x2013; the Turing machine, is a model based on human computers
&#x2013; people who perform mathematical calculations.
</p>

<p>
The purpose of this modeling is to serve Turing's project,
which is to inquire the nature of mathematical calculations,
i.e. to understand computability.
</p></li>

<li><p>
As the art of manufacturing digital computers,
and the art of programming them, are so developed today,
a similar project, to inquire the nature of mathematical truth,
is naturally taken up by mathematicians,
in a certain computer aided way.
</p>

<p>
Since mathematical truth is ensured by deduction,
the steps of which, being written down, is called proof.
</p>

<p>
This time, the model is the type system of programming language,
with which the deductive rules of mathematics are built in,
</p>

<p>
We have type as proposition, function as proof.
</p>

<p>
The language game of mathematics is modeled by
the language game of programming.
[wittgenstein]
</p></li>

<li>The language game of programming is so special,
&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;</li>

<li><p>
constructivism is not to limit &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; the way how mathematics are studied,
[not as early wittgenstein]
but to draw a map
a map with rich information
[bishop's project]
</p>

<p>
just as Turing has successfully did
