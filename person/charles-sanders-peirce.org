    - Peirce's belief that
      this was the most important advance since Boole
      was certainly based on the fact that
      the algebra ofrelations is far more expressive
      than the algebra of propositions,
      and reflects a great deal more of everyday logical inference
      than does Boole'stheory of sets,
      since relations, not just sets,
      are the bread and butter ofreasoning.

    - In this early work on the calculus of relatives,
      Peirce shows more concern with
      maintaining the analogies between
      the notation he is setting forth
      and ordinary algebraic notation
      than with giving a direct account of the problem at hand.
