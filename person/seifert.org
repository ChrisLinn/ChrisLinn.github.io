*** 1 illustrative material

***** 1 the principal problem of topology

      - from now on, then,
        we will make a distinction
        between the intrinsic topological properties of a figure,
        that is, those properties which are preserved
        under all topological mappings of the figure,
        and the remaining [extrinsic] properties,
        which depend upon the figure's placement in space,
        and which are preserved
        only under topological mappings of the whole space.

      - the property which distinguishes a complex
        from an arbitrary point set of a space is its triangulability :

        as a consequence of the triangulability property,
        most so-called pathological point sets will be excluded from our considerations.

      - for the time being, however,
        we will try to see how far we can take the principal problem
        without using these aids [homology and homotopy groups].

      - We can then recognize the following classes of equivalent points
        in a system of polygons :
        - an inner point of a polygon is equivalent only to itself;
        - an innerpoint of a polygonal side
          is equivalent to exactly one other point;
        - a vertex may be equivalent to one, several, or even no other points.
