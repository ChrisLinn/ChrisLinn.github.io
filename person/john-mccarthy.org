* (1963) a basis for a mathematical theory of computation

*** 1 introduction

    - the limitations on what we have been able to make computers do
      come far more from our weakness as programmers
      than from the intrinsic limitations of the machines.
      we hope that these limitations can be greatly reduced
      by developing a mathematical science of computation.

    - there are three established directions of mathematical research
      relevant to a science of computation :

      1. numerical analysis :
         too narrow to be of much help in forming a general theory.

      2. the theory of computability, as a branch of recursive function theory :
         focus on unsolvability instead of positive results.

      3. the theory of finite automata :
         finiteness is not practical.

    - first we discuss briefly what practical results can be hoped for
      from a suitable mathematical theory.

      1. to develop a universal programming language.
         the formalism for describing computations in this paper
         is not presented as a candidate for a universal programming language
         because it lacks a number of features, mainly syntactic,
         which are necessary for convenient use.

      2. to define a theory of the equivalence of computation processes.
         with such a theory we can define equivalence preserving transformations.

* (1996) towards a mathematical science of computation

* (1999) the common business communication language

*** 1 the problem of inter-computer communication

    - The inventory control computer of company A
      would write on the screen of a clerk
      in the purchasing department
      a statement that 1000 gross of such-and-such pencils were needed
      and that they should be purchased from company B.

    - The clerk would turn to her typewriter and type out a purchase order.
      At company B another clerk would receive the purchase order
      and turn to her terminal and tell the computer to arrange to ship the pencils.

    - Suppose we wish to eliminate the clerks
      by having the computers speak directly to each other.
      What are the requirements?

*** 2 requirements

    - Our goal -
      1. A common language is to be adopted
         that can express business communications.
      2. Any organization should be able to communicate with any other
         without pre-arrangement over ordinary dial-up telephone connections.
         this requires authentication procedures
         and verification of authorization procedures.
      3. The system should be open ended so that as programs improve,
         programs that can at first only order by stock numbers
         can later be programmed to inquire about specifications and prices
         and decide on the best deal.
      4. CBCL is strictly a communication protocol.
         It should not presuppose any data-base format
         for the storage within machines of the information communicated,
         and it should not presuppose anything about the programs that use the language.
         Each business using the language
         would have a program designed to use the particular part of CBCL
         relevant to its business communications.
         Thus CBCL presupposes nothing about the programs that decide
         when to order or what orders to accept.
      5. CBCL is not concerned with the low-level aspects of the message formats.

    - We do not have a final proposal but here are some ideas :
      1. The messages are lists of items punctuated by parentheses.
         The lead item of each list identifies the type of message
         and is used to determine how to interpret the rest.
         The items may be either sublists or atoms.
         If an item is a sublist,
         its first element tells how to interpret it.
         Atoms are binary numbers of say 32 bits.
         A dictionary tells what each means.
         Other forms of data may be used
         provided they are demarcated by appropriate punctuation
         and provided they are pointed at from lists
         that tell how they are to be interpreted.
      2. here are some examples :
         1. (request-quote (your-stock-number a7305) (units 100))
         2. (request-quote (pencils #2) (gross 100))
            - the above two examples correspond directly to what has been
              proposed for ICE apart from the names of the structures.
         3. (request-quote (adjective (pencils #2) yellow) (gross 100))
            - the point of adjective is that
              a program not understanding yellow
              could nevertheless understand that
              #2 pencils were called for,
              and could reply that they donâ€™t have any pencils,
              if that were so.
         4. (we-quote (our-stock-number a7305) (quantity 100)
             (delivery-date 3-10-77) (price $1.00))
         5. (please-say (iota (x) (and (red x) (pencil x))))

    - x -
      (<binder> (<variable> ...) <body>)
      (sexp sexp ...)
