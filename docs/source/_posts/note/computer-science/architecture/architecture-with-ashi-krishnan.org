  - everything we do must either solve a problem or create a problem.
    creating problem is the domain of art,
    solving problem is the domain of engineering.

  - solving problem is all about the questions you ask.
    what problem am I trying to solve?
    what is my input?
    what is my output?
    what is my test?
