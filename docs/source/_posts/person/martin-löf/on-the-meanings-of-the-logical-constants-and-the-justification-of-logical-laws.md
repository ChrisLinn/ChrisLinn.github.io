# First lecture

History of the use of the word "proposition" and the word "judgement" in logic and philosophy.
And how the lecturer will use them.

- **[Xie]** A proposition is an expression that is used as operand of logical operations.
  A judgement is a higher level expression that is used as premises or conclusion in inference rules.

  One deduction system might have many form of judgements.
  For example, in bidirectional type checking, we have "checking mode" and "infering mode".

  Modal logic is an example of pushing judgement level expression down to proposition level expression,
  For example, the judgement "A is necessary." is used as a proposition in "A is necessary is true."
