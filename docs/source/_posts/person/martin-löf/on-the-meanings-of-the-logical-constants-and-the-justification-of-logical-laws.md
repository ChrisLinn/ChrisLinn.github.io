# First lecture

History of the use of the word "proposition" and the word "judgement" in logic and philosophy.
And how the lecturer will use them.

- **[Xie]** A proposition is an expression that is used as operand of logical operations.
  A judgement is a higher level expression that is used as premises or conclusion in inference rules.

  One deduction system might have many form of judgements.
  For example, in bidirectional type checking, we have "checking mode" and "infering mode".

  Modal logic is an example of pushing judgement level expression down to proposition level expression,
  For example, the judgement "A is necessary."
  is used as a proposition in "A is necessary is true."
  where "_ is necessary" denotes a logical operation.

- **[Xie]** The following definition of judgement is famous.

Now, the question, What is a judgement? is no small question,
because the notion of judgement is just about the first of all the notions of logic,
the one that has to be explained before all the others,
before even the notions of proposition and truth, for instance.
There is therefore an intimate relation between the answer to the question
what a judgement is and the very question what logic itself is.
I shall start by giving a very simple answer,
which is essentially right: after some elaboration, at least,
I hope that we shall have a sufficiently clear understanding of it.
And the definition would simply be that,
**when understood as an act of judging, a judgement is nothing but an act of knowing,
and, when understood as that which is judged, it is a piece or, more solemnly, an object of knowledge**.
