## First lecture

History of the use of the word "proposition" and the word "judgement" in logic and philosophy.
And how the lecturer will use them.

- **[Xie]**
  The study and development of the author's theory
  is heavily based on etymology, i.e. the study of the origin of words.
  How would the development be different
  if we follow the etymology of Chinese instead of western language ?

- **[Xie]** A proposition is an expression that is used as operand of logical operations.
  A judgement is a higher level expression that is used as premises or conclusion in inference rules.

  One deduction system might have many form of judgements.
  For example, in bidirectional type checking, we have "checking mode" and "infering mode".

  Modal logic is an example of pushing judgement level expression down to proposition level expression,
  For example, the judgement "A is necessary."
  is used as a proposition in "A is necessary is true."
  where "... is necessary" denotes a logical operation.

- **[Xie]** The following definition of judgement is famous.

Now, the question, What is a judgement? is no small question,
because the notion of judgement is just about the first of all the notions of logic,
the one that has to be explained before all the others,
before even the notions of proposition and truth, for instance.
There is therefore an intimate relation between the answer to the question
what a judgement is and the very question what logic itself is.
I shall start by giving a very simple answer,
which is essentially right: after some elaboration, at least,
I hope that we shall have a sufficiently clear understanding of it.
And the definition would simply be that,
**when understood as an act of judging, a judgement is nothing but an act of knowing,
and, when understood as that which is judged, it is a piece or, more solemnly, an object of knowledge**.

The act of judging is the same as the act of knowing,
and that what is judged is the object of knowledge.

  | context     | judgement            | definition             |
  |-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
  | extensional | act of judging       | an act of knowing      |
  | intensional | that which is judged | an object of knowledge |

- **[Xie]** Then, what is "knowing" ? Which is even a deeper question.
  Maybe just the intuitions like
  "I am sure that ...",
  "I am sure that possibly ...",
  "I am sure that necessarily ...",
  and so on.

The important thing to realize is
of course that to judge and to know,
and, correlatively, judgement and knowledge,
are essentially the same.
And, when the relation between judgement, or assertion, if you prefer,
and knowledge is understood in this way,
logic itself is naturally understood as the theory of knowledge,
that is, of demonstrative knowledge.
Thus logic studies, from an objective point of view, our pieces of knowledge
as they are organized in demonstrative science,
or, if you think about it from the act point of view,
it studies our acts of judging, or knowing, and how they are interrelated.

Is a judgement a judgement already before it is grasped, that is, becomes known,
or does it become a judgement only through our act of judging?
And, in the latter case, what should we call a judgement
before it has been judged, that is, has become known?

| before prove | after prove       |
|--------------|-------------------|
| judgement    | evident judgement |
| proposition  | true proposition  |

- **[Xie]** The author is cornered and come up with the word "enunciation",
  I would suggest the word "claim".
