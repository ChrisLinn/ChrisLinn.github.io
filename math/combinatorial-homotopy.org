#+title: combinatorial homotopy

* combinatorial group theory

*** motivation

    study group by generators and relations

*** underlying-space [classifying-space]

    only one point [base-point]

    generator     as  edge (occur once)
    relation      as  face (occur once)
    group element as  path

    (= G (fundamental-group (underlying-space G)))
    the underlying-space itself
    can be viewed as the combinatorial representation of the group
    [by generators and relations]

*** cayley-graph [covering-space]

    one point for each group element

    generator     as  edge (occur at each point)
    relation      as  face (occur at each point)
    group element as  point

    we can give geometric to covering-space

* groupoid

* combinatorial homotopy
