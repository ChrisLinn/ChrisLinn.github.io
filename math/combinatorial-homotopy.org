#+title: combinatorial homotopy

* combinatorial group theory

*** motivation

    study group by generators and relations

*** underlying-space [classifying-space]

    only one point [base-point]

    generator     as  edge (occur once)
    relation      as  face (occur once)
    group element as  path

    (= G (fundamental-group (underlying-space G)))
    the underlying-space itself
    can be viewed as the combinatorial representation of the group
    [by generators and relations]

*** cayley-graph [covering-space]

    one point for each group element

    generator     as  edge (occur at each point)
    relation      as  face (occur at each point)
    group element as  point

    we can give geometric to covering-space

* groupoid

* combinatorial homotopy

  - 當使用很強的等價關係時
    對圖形的研究就可以被代數化
    這就是代數拓撲

  - 當用多邊形[polygonal schema]構造曲面時
    這種構造就是曲面基本羣的展示[presentation]

  - 曲面的基本羣的同構問題
    是如何解決的 ?
