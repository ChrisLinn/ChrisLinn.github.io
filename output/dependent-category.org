*** a concern

    - if we generalize category,
      then we can not directly reuse the mathematical constructions
      that have been developed based on category.

      we have to re-develop all those constructions all over again.

* abstract

  - In this paper I provide a generalization of category,
    I call it dependent category,
    because the motivation of defining it
    is to use it to model the semantic of dependent type systems.

  - I will outline the axioms of my so called dependent category,
    and provide examples as its instances alone the way.
