*** a categorical model for dependent type system

*** a categorical model for stack based concatenative programming language

    - my question :
      https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/homotopytypetheory/IU5bsqSNuiM

*** fibrations

*** operad

    - morphisms that have multiple sources
      (multiple targets are easy to encode using products).
      Itâ€™s called an operad.

*** monoidal category

    - This looks more like a combination of composition and tensoring,
      in a monoidal category.
      Based on some stuff in a blog post :

      - https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/2017/11/the_polycategory_of_multivaria.html

    - the cut rule is instead composition in a polycategory,
      and you can only cut out one type at a time.

* [note]

* plan

  - a category U where we can to unification on objects

  - and a generalization of category
    based on the categorical structure of U
