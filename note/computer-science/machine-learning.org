* definition

  - Arthur Samuel (1959)
    Machine learning study how to give computers the ability to learn
    without being explicitly programmed

  - Tom Mitchell (1998)
    well posed learning problem:
    A programm is said to *learn* from experience E
    with respect to some tesk T
    and performance measure P,
    if its performance on T as measured by P
    improves with more and more E

* supervised learning

  - right answers are given
    data are labeled

  - curve fitting problem
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting

  - regression problem -- predict continuous function
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis

  - classification problem -- predict discrete function

  - examples
    - image classification

* unsupervised learning

  - data are not labeled

  - find structures and relations in data

  - clustering problem
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis

  - examples
    - google news clustering
    - language model -- learn to predict next word in a sentence
    - clustering people by genes
    - market segmentation for sells
    - cocktail part problem -- separate people's voices
    - image processing -- clustering pixels

* learning theory

  - theorems about when learning algorithm will work

* reinforcement learning

  - sequence of decisions

  - reward function -- train dogs

  - game play (game tree)

  - self driving car and robotic

* linear regression

  - learning-algorithm :
    -- training-set
    -> h : -- x : feature -> y : target
    where h is hypothesizes function

  - representation of hypothesizes
    h is represented by a linear function
    the linear function is represented by a list of parameter -- theta
    theta -- parameter of the model
    -- yoneda embedding of (single return value) linear function

  - cost function -- squared error function
    find theta by we minimizing cost function

  - gradient descent
    - batch gradient descent
    - stochastic gradient descent -- incremental gradient descent
      in one step, updating theta only using some (one) training data
      but in many steps, all the data will be made use of

  - normal equations -- solve theta in close form
