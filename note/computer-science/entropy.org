#+title: entropy

* definitions

  - hot thing is only useful for turning wheels
    when it is spreading its energy to cold thing.
    (thinking about Sterling engine)

    once the hot and cold are evenly distributed,
    (once the energy is used)
    one can not use it anymore.

    thus, entropy is a measure of how spread out your energy is.

    using energy is making hot and cold even.

  - why non-evenly distributed states tend to spreading out evenly ?
    because statistically non-evenly distributed states are so rare.

  - entropy always increase, the universal will be evenly cold in the end.

  - entropy can be used to define direction of time.
