#+title: model theory

* [note]

  - model theory is the study of classes of mathematical structures
    (e.g. groups, fields, graphs, universes of set theory)
    from the perspective of mathematical logic.

  - model theory recognises
    and is intimately concerned with a duality:
    it examines semantical elements (meaning and truth)
    by means of syntactical elements (formulas and proofs)
    of a corresponding language.

  - non-standard analysis is an example of model theory
