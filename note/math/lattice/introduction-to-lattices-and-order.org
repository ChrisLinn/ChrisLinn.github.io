* 1 ordered sets

*** terms

    - (order) (partial order)
      reflexivity, antisymmetry and transitivity

      A set P equipped with an order relation
      is said to be an ordered set
      (or partially ordered set) (or poset)

    - (discrete order)
      on any set, == is an order

    - (quasi-order) (pre-order)
      reflexivity and transitivity

    - (strict inequality)
      x <= y and x != y

    - (comparable)
      x <= y or x >= y

    - (incomparable)
      not x <= y and not x >= y

    - (induced order)
      the order that subset inherited from superset

    - (chain) (linearly ordered set) (totally ordered set)
      either x <= y or x >= y

    - (antichain)
      x <= y then x == y

      when using the term chain and antichain, we are often considering subsets

      A chain is a subset in which each pair of elements is comparable;
      that is, C is totally ordered.

      An antichain is a subset in which each pair of different elements is incomparable;
      that is, there is no order relation between any two different elements.

    - (order-isomorphism)
      necessarily bijective
      using reflexivity and antisymmetry
      f(x) == f(y)
      <=> f(x) <= f(y) and f(x) =< f(y)
      <=> x <= y and x =< y
      <=> x == y

*** informative

    - for data, >= can be defined as
      "is at least as informative as"

* 2 lattices and complete lattices
