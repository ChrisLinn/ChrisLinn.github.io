* intro

  - probability as a mathematical framework
    for reasoning about uncertainty

* probabilistic models

  - sample space -- set of outcomes
    we record which outcome is more likely to occur compare to others
    by assigning probability to outcome.

    but to deal with continuous sample space
    we must adjust our method by assigning probability to events
    where an event is a subset of sample space

    this definition also handles discrete sample space well
    by viewing assigning probability to sets of one element

  - probability axioms

    - nonnegative -
      -- A : sample-space -> P (A) >= 0

    - normalization -
      P (sample-space) = 1

    - additivity -
      -- intersection (A B) = empty-set
      -> P (union (A B)) = add (P (A) P (B))

    - countable additivity -
      the additivity axiom need to be generalized to sequence of subsets
      instead of just two subsets
      (where sequence implies countable)

    the axioms looks like integration of some function over sample-space

  - extra notes about subsets of sample-space
    ignore ugly and weird subsets
    because for some weird subsets we can not both
    assigning probability to them and maintain probability axioms
    - x -
      this also revealed set theory's inconvenience,
      but why we are not using type theory yet ?
      will type theory be even more inconvenient ?

  - x -
    dealing with subsets remembers me of relational programming

  - discrete uniform distribution
    all outcomes be equally likely
    compute probability = counting

  - continuous uniform distribution
    probability = area
