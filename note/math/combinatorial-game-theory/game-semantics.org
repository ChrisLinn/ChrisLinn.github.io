#+title: game semantic

* [note]

  - type == proposition == game of argument between defender and prosecutor

  - object [or function] == proof == winning strategy of defender
    - the prosecutor is allowed to replay the game
      and attack in all the ways
    - true proposition can endure all attacks

  - for propositional logic
    we reduce cards on both side
    and at the end, compare cards of both side

    this is a game
    because it involves choices of both players
    when dealing with disjunction

  - if we view disjunction as sum of game
    we can say
    proof == a winning play of defender

    - x -
      the "sum of game" is not disjunctive sum of normal play game
      because we are using cards to calculate winning
