#+title: the plan

* the miniature plan of life

  - If he maps out important work for himself on great lines,
    a glance at this miniature plan
    of his life will, more than anything else
    stimulate, rouse and ennoble him,
    urge him on to action and keep him from false paths.

* a day

  - We are apt to forget that every day is an integral,
    and therefore irreplaceable portion of life,
    and to look upon life as though it were a collective idea or name
    which does not suffer if one of the individuals it covers is destroyed.

    the plan must not only be about language design.
