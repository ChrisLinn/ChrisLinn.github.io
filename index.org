* about me

  - I view myself as a programming language designer
    I am trying to design programming languages

  - my aim of programming language design
    is to explore the usage of
    'proposition as type' and 'program as proof'
    for algebraic topological purpose

* language design

  - [[http://xieyuheng.github.io/jojo][jojo]] -- jojo's programming adventure

  - [[http://xieyuheng.github.io/sequent1][sequent1]] -- a prototype functional language
    which uses sequent calculus as its dependent type system

  - [[https://github.com/xieyuheng/recursive-combinator][recursive-combinator]] -- dsl embedded in js
    inspired by joy (the language)
    implemented by an interpreter of js array
