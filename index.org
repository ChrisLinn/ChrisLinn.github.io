- welcome ^-^/

* me

  - Hi I am xieyuheng.
    I like mathematics, philosophy and traditional Chinese.

  - I view myself as a programming language designer.
    I am always trying to design programming languages.

  - My aim of programming language design
    is to explore the usage of 'proposition as type'
    for algebraic topological purpose.

*** experiences

***** 2015

      - Graduated from SYSU, GuangZhou, China, with bachelor's degree.
        My major was pure and applied mathematics.

***** 2015 -- 2017

      - Rest -- like an interval of silence in a piece of music.

***** 2017 -- now

      - Currently I am working at [[https://www.ricequant.com][RiceQuant]], as a junior python programmer,
        learning quantitative trading! great!

    - four basic principles for constructivism / 構造主義基本四原則

      - (A) Mathematics is common sense.
        (B) Do not ask whether a statement is true until you know what it means.
        (C) A proof is any completely convincing argument.
        (D) Meaningful distinctions deserve to be maintained.

      - (A) 數學即常識
        (B) 別問一個論斷是否真實 除非你明瞭論斷的意思
        (C) 使你信服的論證皆爲證明
        (D) 有意義的區別值得保留
