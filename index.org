- welcome to my home page ^-^/

* me

  - Hi I am xieyuheng, I was born at 1992 in China.
    I like mathematics, philosophy and traditional Chinese.

  - I view myself as a programming language designer.
    I am always trying to design programming languages.

  - My aim of programming language design
    is to explore the usage of
    'proposition as type' and 'program as proof'
    for algebraic topological purpose.

*** experiences

***** [2015]

      - Graduated from SYSU, GuangZhou, China, with bachelor's degree.
        My major was pure and applied mathematics.

***** [2015 -- 2016]

      - I hanged around at [[http://szdiy.org][SZDIY hacherspace]] at BaiShiZhou, unemployed.

***** [2016 -- now]

      - Still unemployed.

      - I have no working experiences.
        I am actively trying find a job.

      - I am competent programmer and fast learner.
        Given an opportunity,
        I can learn your fields and tool chains in time,
        and help you solving programming problems.

      - Contact me by email if you have an offer.
