- welcome ^-^/

* me

  - Hi I am xieyuheng.
    I like mathematics, philosophy and traditional Chinese.

  - I view myself as a programming language designer.
    I am always trying to design programming languages.

  - My aim of programming language design
    is to explore the usage of 'proposition as type'
    for algebraic topological purpose.

*** experiences
