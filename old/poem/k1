喪以不執 所執者喪 執喪相比 方死方生

I'm an unhappy shadow pondering with whisper and weep, drop by drop swallowed by the eve.

長悲嘆而掩面兮 憐其獨於夢睹
涕执我乎垂丧兮 懼余生之茫苦

I invented the colour of vowels
A black E white I red O blue U green
I organized the shape and movement of every consonant
and by instinctive rhythms flattered myself that
I was the inventor of a poetic language
accessible sooner or later to all the senses
interpretation i kept for myself
firstly it is a study
I wrote down silences
I wrote down nights
I noted inexpressible
I fixed the vertigos
-- Arthur Rimbaud
